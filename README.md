# link-lounge

This is a repository of all the links and bookmarks that I want to save for future reference.

All data is stored in the `data.json` file and compiled into a static site when built to provide a searchable UI in the browser.

## How to use

Use `npm run update-data` and follow the CLI to update the data.json with new entries.

Use `npm run build` to generate the static site.


## To Do

- Style it
- Tag-based search and filtering
- Fix issue with dist folder not being created on first run
